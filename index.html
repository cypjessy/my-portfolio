        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a passionate and self-driven web developer based in Kenya with
          over 2 years of freelance experience creating modern, responsive
          websites and scalable web applications. I specialize in front-end
          development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also work with
          backend technologies like Node.js and Express. Iâ€™m skilled in building
          dynamic websites using WordPress and integrating local services such
          as M-Pesa for seamless payments. I have a strong interest in mobile
          app development and enjoy learning new tools and technologies. My goal
          is to deliver clean, user-focused digital solutions that help
          businesses grow, improve workflows, and reach more customers online.
